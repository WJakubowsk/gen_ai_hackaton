## Risk Analysis

Risk analysis is perfomed in two-ways:
1. Software Risk analysis.
This is performed using GitGuardian software. It checks for any vulnerabilities in the existing source code, including Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, outdated libraries, license issues etc.

2. Infrastructure risk analysis.
This is performed using Azure Security Center. It is a service provided by Azure cloud to monitor deployed resources. It inspects vulnerabilities and suggests recommendations for provided resources.
